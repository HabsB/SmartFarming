# IoT Systems in Smart Farming
This is a repository for Model Driven Engineering(MDE) Project that models IoT system in Smart farming technology, particularly Closed Environment Farming(CEF).

The repository Contains four projects within:

  * MPS Platform - for defining the metamodels within IoT for Smart Farming.
  * EMF Platform -  for defining the metamodels within IoT for Smart Farming.
  * Epsilon (ETL and EGL) - for model transformation
  * xText and Sirius - for development of textual and graphical editors.
