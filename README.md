# IoT Systems in Smart Farming
This is a repository for Model Driven Engineering(MDE) Project that models IoT system in Smart farming technology, particularly Closed Environment Farming(CEF).

The repository Contains four projects within:

  * MPS Platform - for defining the metamodels within IoT for Smart Farming.
  * EMF Platform -  for defining the metamodels within IoT for Smart Farming.
  * Epsilon (ETL and EGL) - for model transformation
  * xText and Sirius - for development of textual and graphical editors.

## 1. Describing Domain Specific Concepts
Smart Farming can mean different things, Since we are focusing on IoT systems for Smart farming, we considered an application that maximizes the use of IoT devices, i.e. Controlled Environment Farming(CEF). Controlled Environment Farming(CEF) is a type of smart farming, Which is indoor and all the agricultural metrics are monitored and controlled to give the maximum harvest.
